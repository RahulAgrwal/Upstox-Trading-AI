## 📖 Overview

Sage Trade AI NSE is a next-generation trading system that combines traditional technical analysis with the cognitive power of Large Language Models (LLMs). By utilizing models like Google Gemini 1.5/2.0/3.0 and OpenAI GPT-4o/5-mini/5-pro, the agent simulates a professional human analyst.

It doesn't just look at numbers; it "reasons" through multi-modal data—including candlestick patterns, real-time news sentiment, and volume clusters—to execute high-probability intraday trades via the Upstox API.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **LLM-Powered Reasoning**: Moves beyond static logic to interpret market "context" and news catalysts using state-of-the-art AI.
- 📊 **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Processes both tabular technical indicators (RSI, MACD) and visual chart patterns.
- ⚡ **Automated Lifecycle**: Handles everything from morning stock selection to automated Stop-Loss (SL) management and End-of-Day (EOD) square-offs.
- 📰 **Sentiment Integration**: Uses NewsAPI to gauge market mood before entering positions.
- 🛡️ **Institutional-Grade Risk Management**: Strict position sizing based on available margin and user-defined risk-per-trade.
- 🔌 **RESTful Interface**: Built on Flask, allowing you to monitor or trigger the agent via webhooks or external dashboards.

## 🤖 Agentic Workflow: The Decision Engine

The Sage Trade AI NSE operates as an autonomous cycle, mimicking a high-frequency professional trader. Below is the step-by-step operational logic of the agent.

### Phase 1: Market Scanning & Visual Pre-Selection
- **Universe Filtering:** Fetches the current NIFTY 200 stock list from the NSE and retrieves real-time price snapshots via the Upstox API.
- **Stochastic Sampling:** Selects 10 high-probability stocks for visual analysis, optimizing LLM usage while preserving diversity.
- **Visual Plotting:** Uses yfinance to generate candlestick charts for these 10 candidates.
- **Multi-Modal Selection:** Sends all 10 charts to the LLM for Visual Pattern Recognition (identifies support/resistance, trends, breakouts). The LLM selects the single "Stock of the Day" with the highest edge.

### Phase 2: Contextual Deep-Dive & Data Augmentation
Once a specific stock is selected, the agent aggregates a "Full Context" payload to ensure robust decision-making:
- **Account Intel:** Fetches Upstox available margin, active portfolio positions.
- **Market Snapshot:** Provides intraday candles, volume, and technical summaries (RSI, MACD, VWAP).
- **Memory Integration:** Reviews prior trading decisions to avoid repeat mistakes.
- **Knowledge Base:** Optionally augments with proprietary training content (e.g., provided PDF of your rules).

### Phase 3: Reasoning & Autonomous Execution
- **Agentic Inference:** LLM processes the entire payload (visual, technical, historical, account data).
- **The Directive:** Outputs a strict decision: BUY, SELL, or HOLD, with reasoning, precise Entry, SL, and Target.
- **Automated Action:** The upstox_Agent SDK translates this into a live order, calculates correct quantity based on leverage and risk controls, and places the trade.

### Phase 4: Iterative Feedback Loop
- **100-Second Polling:** Complete analysis repeats every 100 seconds; not a "buy and forget" agent.
- **Active Management:** Reassesses all live positions—trails stops, takes profit, or exits as market conditions shift.


## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Detail
| Component            | Technology                                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Market Data          | Upstox API & yfinance                           |
| Visual Reasoning     | LLM (Gemini-Vision / GPT-4o)                    |
| Strategy Logic       | RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), PDF rules |
| Execution            | Upstox Python SDK                               |
| Scheduling           | Async loop, 100s polling interval               |

## 🛡️ Operational Safeguards
- **Dynamic Margin Check:** Will not attempt trade if available margin is below threshold.
- **Leverage Control:** Uses configured Intraday Leverage to maximize efficiency, avoiding liquidation.
- **Portfolio Awareness:** Cross-references active positions, prevents conflicts and overexposure.
